# Object-Aware-SLAM
This is the open source repository of my first paper "Object-Aware  SLAM  Based  on  Efficient  Quadric  Initialization  and Joint  Data  Association", which is ready to commit to RAL &amp; IROS 2022.

Here is the primary performance of our Efficient  Quadric  Initialization (EQI) algorithm:

Here is the youtube link of the  full run performance on one TUM sequence: [Object-Aware-SLAM](https://youtu.be/Ng6E-lpqJ6E).

Once our paper is accepted, we will open source our code.
